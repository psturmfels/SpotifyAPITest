### For Mac Users

1. We'll first need to download Node.js and npm, which is Node's package manager.

2. To get Node and npm, we'll run the command:
```
brew install node
```

3. What's Homebrew? Well they describe themselves as the "package manager that installs stuff that Apple didnt". To install Homebrew run:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
