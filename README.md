-We'll first need to download Node.js and npm, which is Node's package manager.

-To get Node and npm, we'll run the command:
```
brew install node
```

-Homebrew describes themselves as the package manager that installs stuff that Apple didnt. To install Homebrew run:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
